# Restaurant Reviews - Stage 1

### Description
This is a project developed for the Udacity & Google Front End Web Developer Scholarship.
The project had 3 stages and this is stage 1.
In stage one, the project had to be converted from a static, un-responsive and innaccesible web page, into a dynamic, responsive and accesible page. Also, the use of Service Workers was required to make the website accesible offline.

### Dependencies
This project was built using Udacity's boilerplate that contains the following files:
  * js\app.js
  * js\dbhelper.js
  * js\restaurant_info.js
  * css\style.css
  * data\restaurants.json
  * img\
  * index.html
  * restaurant.html
  * sw.js
Normalize.css library was used.


### Installation
Not required.


### Usage
1. In root folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer. 

In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

2. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`, and look around for a bit to see what the current experience looks like.
3. Explore the provided code, and make start making a plan to implement the required features in three areas: responsive design, accessibility and offline use.
4. Write code to implement the updates to get this site on its way to being a mobile-ready website.


### Note about ES6
Most of the code in this project has been written to the ES6 JavaScript specification for compatibility with modern web browsers and future proofing JavaScript code. As much as possible, try to maintain use of ES6 in any additional JavaScript you write.
